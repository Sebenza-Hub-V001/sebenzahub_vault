# Offer System

The Offer System is one of Sebenza Hub's most sophisticated subsystems — a full lifecycle management tool for creating, approving, negotiating, and tracking job offers. It includes AI-powered negotiation strategy, compliance checking, salary benchmarking, and multi-step approval workflows.

## Offer Lifecycle

```
Draft → Pending Approval → Sent → Viewed → Accepted / Negotiation / Declined / Expired
                                              ↓
                                    Counter-offer rounds
                                    (company ↔ candidate)
                                              ↓
                                    Resolved / Withdrawn
```

### Status Values (`offers.status`)

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Created but not submitted for approval |
| `pending_approval` | In approval workflow |
| `sent` | Delivered to candidate |
| `accepted` | Candidate accepted |
| `declined` | Candidate declined |
| `expired` | Time-limited, no response |
| `withdrawn` | Retracted by employer |

### Negotiation Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `none` | No negotiation |
| `in_progress` | Active negotiation rounds |
| `resolved` | Negotiation concluded |

## Database Tables (12 tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `offers` | Core offer record (salary, benefits, status, dates) |
| `offerLetters` | Generated offer letter with signature tracking |
| `offerNegotiations` | Negotiation rounds (proposed salary, benefits, who proposed) |
| `negotiationCommunications` | Communication log with sentiment analysis |
| `negotiationDeadlines` | Response deadlines, escalation triggers |
| `negotiationApprovals` | Multi-level approval (manager → dept head → exec) |
| `negotiationCompPackages` | Full compensation packages per round |
| `offerTemplates` | Reusable templates by category and job level |
| `offerApprovalChains` | Sequential approval workflow steps |
| `offerActivityLog` | Audit trail of all offer actions |
| `offerComplianceChecks` | Legal/regulatory compliance validation |
| `offerBenchmarks` | Market salary data by role, region, industry |

## Approval Workflow

Multi-step sequential approval with delegation and escalation:

```
Step 1: Hiring Manager (approval level 1)
  → Approved? → Step 2
  → Rejected? → Back to draft
  → Delegated? → Delegate reviews instead

Step 2: Department Head (approval level 2)
  → Approved? → Step 3 (if required)
  → Escalated? → Auto-notify next level

Step 3: Executive (CFO/CEO) (approval level 3)
  → Approved? → Offer status → "sent"
```

Each step tracks: `maxAuthorizedAmount`, `conditions`, `dueDate`, `reminderSentAt`, `escalatedAt`.

## Negotiation Flow

1. **Initial offer** sent to candidate
2. **Candidate responds** — accept, decline, or counter
3. **Counter-offer rounds** — each round tracked with:
   - `proposedSalary`, `proposedBenefits`
   - `proposedBy` (company or candidate)
   - `status` (pending, accepted, rejected, countered)
4. **Communications logged** per round with sentiment analysis (-100 to +100)
5. **Approval loop** — if counter exceeds authority, escalates for approval
6. **Resolution** — accepted, declined, or expired

## Compensation Packages

Full SA-relevant compensation tracked per negotiation round:

- Base salary, signing bonus, annual bonus, bonus target %
- Commission structure, equity value + vesting schedule
- Allowances: car, housing, medical aid, retirement, study, cellphone, travel
- Leave days, remote work days, relocation assistance
- Total annual value, cost-to-company calculation
